Provide standardMetaschemaLoader that checks embedded schemas first\n4. Support composition: embeddedLoader \u003c|\u003e customLoader to allow overriding/extending\n\n## Benefits\n- Self-contained: no HTTP fetching for standard schemas\n- Reliable: always available, no network failures\n- Fast: no I/O for common cases\n- Enables fractal-yu6 fix to work properly in tests and production\n\n## Related Issues\n- Blocks fractal-yu6 (vocabulary checking needs metaschema access)\n- Improves DX for library users","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-21T16:55:21.56618+01:00","updated_at":"2025-11-21T16:55:31.393119+01:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"fractal-pth","depends_on_id":"fractal-yu6","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-21T16:57:02.432279+01:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Currently test infrastructure returns 'Unknown URI' errors. Need fractal-pth to embed standard metaschemas.\n\n## Verification\nLogic is correct - when metaschema is in registry with proper $vocabulary, validation keywords are correctly skipped.
